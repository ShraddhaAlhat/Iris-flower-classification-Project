 Iris flower classification using KNN 
Welcome to this GitHub repository, a comprehensive resource for Iris flower classification. The Iris flower dataset is a classic in the field of machine learning, featuring three species: Versicolor, Sentosa, and Virginica. Each species is characterized by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

This repository presents two distinct approaches to classify the Iris flowers. The first approach is encapsulated in a Jupyter notebook titled ‘IRIS flower classification.ipynb’. This notebook employs the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, a popular choice for classification tasks. The notebook meticulously outlines each step of the process, from loading the dataset to splitting it into training, validation, and testing sets. The model is then trained using KNN and its performance is evaluated using a classification report and confusion matrix. The final step involves testing the trained model on new data.


In conclusion, this repository serves as a valuable resource for both beginners and experienced practitioners in the field of machine learning. It not only provides practical implementations of two popular machine learning algorithms but also serves as a guide on how to handle real-world datasets and develop machine learning models. Explore the repository and delve into the fascinating world of Iris flower classification!
